# Performance Analysis of Digital Media Campaigns (Looker Studio)  
**Goal:** To compare the performance of campaigns by combining and analyzing ad metrics from Google Ads and Facebook Ads.  
**Method and Tools:** Connected to a PostgreSQL database and used CTEs to combine tables (spend, impressions, clicks, leads, value). Created custom metrics in Looker Studio (Ad Spend, ROMI, CPC, CPM, CTR, ROMI). Added a "media source" field manually and grouped data by date and media source. Used combined bar-line charts, line charts, heatmaps, and filters.  
**Dashboard Design:** Combined bar-line chart showing Ad Spend and ROMI together, line chart showing number of active campaigns per month, comparison table with heatmap by campaign, and filters for date and campaign name.  
**Result**: The campaign performance was compared over time. Monitored ad spending and conversion value. ROMI changed during the period. The combined chart showed that ROMI and Ad Spend moved in opposite directions at some points. This may show opportunities for optimization. The heatmap showed that the most effective campaigns were “Trendy” and “Promos.”  
**Skills Gained:** Data combining using SQL (CTE, JOIN, UNION), metric creation, data modeling and visualization design in Looker Studio, performance analysis for marketing campaigns.
